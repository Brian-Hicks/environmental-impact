	    <p>The<b> Environmental Impact Assessment</b> application allows the public and individuals within an organization to determine potential impacts of development on the natural environment.</p>
        <h4><u>Finding Information</u></h4>
        <p>Individuals and organizations can use the Environmental Impact Assessment application to define an area of interest based on a particular development project, and generate a report of what environmental features may be impacted by that project.  Results can be viewed directly within the application, or can be downloaded for further distribution and use.</p>
        <h4><u>Map Based Navigation</u></h4>
        <p>There are several ways to interact with the map:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tap a point of interest you&#39;d like to see</li>
                <li>Hold down the shift key and drag a box on the map to zoom in</li>
                <li>Hold down Ctrl+Shift to zoom out</li>
                <li>Roll your mouse roller to zoom in/out</li>
            </ol> 
        <h4><u>Searching</u></h4>
        <p>Define your area of interest (AOI) to discover environmental features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the Placename option to define your area of interest using an address</li>
                <li>Use drawing tools or select features to define your area of interest</li>
                <li>Define your area of interest by uploading a zipped shapefile</li>
                <li>Use coordinates and a series of bearings and distances to define your area of interest</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Click on the Report panel to view a summary of environmental features that may be affected by development in your defined AOI.  View results directly in the application, or download summary reports for further distribution and use.</p>
        <h4><u>Browser Compatibility</u></h4>
